**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard using Tableau**

**Project Overview**

This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze electric vehicle (EV) data. The dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into EV performance, market trends, and adoption rates. By visualizing key metrics and data trends, the dashboard aims to support strategic decision-making, market analysis, and policy development in the electric vehicle sector.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Market Overview:** Visualize overall market trends for electric vehicles, including sales figures, market share, and growth rates.
1. **Performance Analysis:** Assess the performance of different EV models, including metrics such as range, efficiency, and customer ratings.
1. **Adoption Trends:** Analyze the adoption rates of electric vehicles over time, including factors influencing growth and regional differences.
1. **Geographical Insights:** Map EV data by region to identify high-adoption areas and analyze regional market dynamics.
1. **Cost and Incentives:** Explore data related to the costs of electric vehicles, available incentives, and their impact on adoption rates.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis includes comprehensive records of electric vehicle data, with key fields such as:

- **Sales Data:** Information on EV sales figures, market share, and growth rates.
- **Vehicle Details:** Data on various EV models, including specifications such as range, efficiency, and performance metrics.
- **Adoption Data:** Records of EV adoption rates over time, including factors influencing growth.
- **Geographical Data:** Information on EV sales and adoption by region or country.
- **Cost and Incentives Data:** Details on the costs of EVs, available incentives, and their effects on market adoption.
